Sudoku app

Rules for sudoku:
*Game is filled with numbers from 1 - 9
*Square is made up of single cells in a 9*9 format
*Each 3*3 square should have the numbers 1 - 9
*Each row ld have the numbers 1-9
*Each column should have the numbers 1-9
*There should be no repeat numbers in any of the squares, rows or coloumns

How the class will run
*The game should be randomised for repeat playing
*The player will only see some of numbers and has to figure out the rest
*When the player enters all the numbers correctly, the guess will be compared to the class array and give a win message
*The game will randomise and start again

Algorithm for creating a new game
*The boc can be boken down into rows, coloumns and boxes. 
*R1-R9	C1-C9	B1-B9
*R1 will be filled across.
*R2,C1 will start to fill. The number will run 3 checks to see if its valid

Check 1: Row 
*Is the number in the row above a repeat?
*This is repeated until R1 in the matching column has been confirmed not a repeat.
Check has been passed.

Check 2: Column
*Is the number in the column along a repeat?
*This is repeated until C1 in the same row has been confirmed not a repeat.
Check has passed.

Check 3: Box
*is the number in box a repeat?
*This starts at the first number in the current box (B1-9), the first row in the box (R1/4/7) and the first column in the box (C1/4/7)
*The check moves along a column until it checks the last number in the column, now it moves back to thefirst column on the row down.
*Repeat until all numbers have been checked.
*Check has passed.

Now all checks have been passed. It's not a repeat number so it can be placed in the original index of the sudoku square array.

If the check does not pass, generate a new random number and start the checks again. The random number should be black listed until the check has passed.
